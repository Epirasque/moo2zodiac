Changelog for Zodiac

Version 1.1 Changes:
- 'Large / Cluster' Galaxies are now separated into Large and Cluster. Cluster is the same size as large but allows for
  71 star systems instead of 54
- Two more mirror-modes (slash and backslash) which can be combined with the previous mirror modes allowing you to place
  up to 8 systems symmetrically with a single click; systems that end up outside of the galaxy will not be placed
  (this can happen because the galaxy has a rectangular shape but not a quadratic one)

Version 1.1 Backwards Compatibility: Previous Large/Cluster Galaxies were actually large galaxies, they are now
                                     automatically converted to cluster galaxies when you load them.
