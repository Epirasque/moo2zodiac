Changelog for Zodiac

Version 1.1 Changes:
- 'Large / Cluster' Galaxies are now separated into Large and Cluster. Cluster is the same size as large but allows for
  71 star systems instead of 54
- Three more mirror-modes (slash, backslash, center) which can be combined with the previous mirror modes allowing you
  to place up to 8 systems symmetrically with a single click; systems that end up outside of the galaxy will not be
  placed (this can happen because the galaxy has a rectangular shape but not a quadratic one)
- Established a small minimum distance to other systems when placing new ones in order to prevent accidentally placing
  duplicates (almost) on top of each other, especially when mirroring placements

Version 1.1 Backwards Compatibility: Previous Large/Cluster Galaxies were actually large galaxies, they are now
                                     automatically converted to cluster galaxies when you load them.
