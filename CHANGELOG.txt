Changelog for Zodiac

Version 1.1 Changes:
- Added a support-grid with customizable resolution in parsecs (decimal numbers allowed); also added snap-to-grid toggle
- Star colors can now be customized, the color is indicated by a smaller circle in the middle of the system. However:
  Due to technical limitations, this is purely cosmetic, meaning the planets are randomly generated on a random star
  color! This will likely still be improved in a later version of Zodiac, so that the new color is taken into account
- Added four more mirror-placement-modes (slash, backslash, center, at-system) which can be combined with the previous
  mirror-placement-modes, allowing you to place up to 16 systems symmetrically with a single click; systems that end up
  outside of the galaxy will not be placed (this can happen because the galaxy has a rectangular shape but not a
  quadratic one)
- You can now edit the color and type of the currently selected system
- Right-clicking empty space will now cancel the current selection
- Added diagonal crosshair to better support mirror-placement-modes
- 'Large / Cluster' Galaxies are now separated into Large and Cluster. Cluster is the same size as large but allows for
  71 star systems instead of 54
- Cosmetic changes: various color changes, shortened some range indicator descriptions, adjusted layout
- Established a small minimum distance to other systems when placing new ones in order to prevent accidentally placing
  systems (almost) on top of each other, especially when mirroring placements
- Fixed drawing-order issue: crosshair (and grid) do not draw above wormhole lines and selection markers anymore
- When loading a galaxy: fixed current system placement type selection being overwritten (without selecting the button)
- Fixed rounding issues: all objects are now treated with float precision throughout, until the moment they are exported

Version 1.1 Backwards Compatibility:
- Previous Large/Cluster Galaxies were actually large galaxies, they are now converted to cluster galaxies when loaded
- Previous saved stars are treated as 'Random' color (which they were already before) when loaded
