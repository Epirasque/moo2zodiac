Changelog for Zodiac

Version 1.1.1 Changes:
- Fixed a rounding issue that could result in some Wormholes in 1.0 galaxies not being loaded correctly
- Added an ingame warning popup when trying to start with the wrong galaxy size setting

Version 1.1 Changes:
- Added a support-grid with customizable resolution in parsecs (decimal numbers allowed); also added snap-to-grid toggle
- Star colors can now be customized, the color is indicated by a smaller circle in the middle of the system. However:
  Due to technical limitations, this is purely cosmetic, meaning the planets are randomly generated on a random star
  color! This will likely still be improved in a later version of Zodiac, so that the new color is taken into account
- Added four more mirror-placement-modes (slash, backslash, center, at-system) which can be combined with the previous
  mirror-placement-modes, allowing you to place up to 16 systems symmetrically with a single click; systems that end up
  outside of the galaxy will not be placed (this can happen because the galaxy has a rectangular shape but not a
  quadratic one)
- You can now edit the color and type of the currently selected system
- Right-clicking empty space will now cancel the current selection
- Added diagonal crosshair to better support mirror-placement-modes
- 'Large / Cluster' Galaxies are now separated into Large and Cluster. Cluster is the same size as large but allows for
  71 star systems instead of 54
- Cosmetic changes: various color changes, shortened some range indicator descriptions, adjusted layout
- Established a small minimum distance to other systems when placing new ones in order to prevent accidentally placing
  systems (almost) on top of each other, especially when mirroring placements
- Fixed drawing-order issue: crosshair (and grid) do not draw above wormhole lines and selection markers anymore
- When loading a galaxy: fixed current system placement type selection being overwritten (without selecting the button)
- Fixed rounding issues: all objects are now treated with float precision throughout, until the moment they are exported

Version 1.1 Backwards Compatibility:
- From the zip, extract all files within zodiac/ and choose to overwrite all previous Zodiac 1.0 files in the
  .../150/mods/zodiac/ folder (zodiac.exe, zodiac_core.py, both _TEMPLATE files and several .txt files)
- To convert a galaxy from v1.0 to v1.1, load it from within Zodiac and then save it again (e.g. in the same slot)
- Previous Large/Cluster Galaxies were actually large galaxies, they are now converted to cluster galaxies when loaded
- Previous saved stars are treated as 'Random' color (which they were already before) when loaded
- There is now a very small minimum distance between stars which will also take effect if you load Zodiac 1.0 galaxies,
  resulting in systems (and attached wormholes) not being placed if they are (almost) on top of another system
